# Quantum-Cryptography
Quantum cryptography interface for polarising filters (thought experiment).
+ The code should explain itself, but just in case: this is quantum cryptography, a system using single polarised photons to transmit a message from two devices
+ Completely impractical but, hey, it's pretty damn cool nevertheless.
